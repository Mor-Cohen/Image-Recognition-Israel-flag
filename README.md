Data mining course homework
This program is designed to detect the presence of the Israeli flag in images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). It receives a set of images, some containing the Israeli flag and others without it, and trains a model to classify new images accordingly.

### Requirements
  To run this program, you need the following dependencies:

    OpenCV (cv2)
    NumPy
    Keras
    scikit-learn
  You can install these dependencies using pip:

    pip install opencv-python numpy keras scikit-learn
